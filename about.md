I am interested in data science, graphs, networks and practical applications of scientific methods to real world data.

I have a background in Physics and Mathematics. I have a PhD in Mathematical Physics, obtained in 2007. I have spent many years in various research labs analyzing data or designing new methods for data analysis. I made a break in academic research career in 2017 to create my startup in data science and machine learning. Since 2012, I have focused on graphs and their fascinating properties.
