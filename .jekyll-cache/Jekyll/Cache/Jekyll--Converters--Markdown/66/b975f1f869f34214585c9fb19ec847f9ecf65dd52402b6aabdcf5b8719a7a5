I"‡<p>The Antartic Curcumnavigation Expedition is a scientific expedition that has collected a large amount of data from Antartica. Scientists working on the project would be happy to get some help from experts in data analysis and data scientists. They plan to make the data open and during the first Data Jam at EPFL in Lausanne, some of their data were presented. The goal and the dataset convinced me to join them in the analysis of the sonar data. This post is a short presentation of what we managed to do during the 2 Data Jam Days. It reveals some interesting information about Antartica and on the methods used to analyze sonar signals.</p>
