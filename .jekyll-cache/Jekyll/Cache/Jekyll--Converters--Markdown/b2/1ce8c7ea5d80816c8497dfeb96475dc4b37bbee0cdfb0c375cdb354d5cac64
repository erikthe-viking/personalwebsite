I"©<p>Graph databases raise more and more interest as alternatives to standard SQL databases. Indeed, the graph structure may be better suited when queries are focusing on relationships between entities stored in the database. Cloud companies have spotted this trend and provide new solutions to set up graph databases in the cloud. Amazon and Google have made the choice of providing ways to connect JanusGraph to DynamoDB and BigTable respectively. Microsoft has chosen to provide its own graph database while relying on Gremlin for handling queries. Azure is using Cosmos DB as a backend for it. I have tested the Cosmos graph DB and I want here to share my first impressions.</p>
