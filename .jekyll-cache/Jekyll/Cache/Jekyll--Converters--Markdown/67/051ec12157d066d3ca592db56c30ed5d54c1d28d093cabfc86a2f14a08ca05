I"@<p>On April 3-6 2020 I took part in the Hackathon <a href="https://covid19.lauzhack.com/">LauzHack against COVID-19</a> organized by the LauzHack association and EPFL. It was an interesting experience and I would like to summarize here the results we got during the 3 days on our project, as well as my impressions.</p>
