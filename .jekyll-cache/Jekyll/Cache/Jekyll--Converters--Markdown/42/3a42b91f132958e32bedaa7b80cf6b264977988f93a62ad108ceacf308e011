I"z<p>I recently wanted to refresh my memory about Machine Learning methods. I have spent some time reading tutorials, blogs and Wikipedia. No doubts, the Internet is really useful, this is great. I got back on tracks quickly with the general idea of the mainstream algorithms. However, from time to time, I find some particular points and explanations obscure. This concerns often details about the algorithms which are overlooked. Sometimes, the emphasis is on the main part of the algorithm and some details are left missing. But I found these missing parts quite important to fully understand whatâ€™s going on in the algorithm.</p>
